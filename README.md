# HealthCare_Cost_Analysis
This project aims to analyze a healthcare dataset and predict which customers will be expensive for medical insurance companies. The dataset comprises of 14 columns and information on about 8K customers. The columns cover a wide range of topics, including the individual's unique identity, age, geographic region, gender, education level, marital status, number of children, and healthcare spending. The dataset also covers details about the individual's physical activity, smoking habits, BMI, yearly physical examination status, and hypertension status.

# Goals
1. Provide actionable insights by analyzing the data, identify key drivers that decide which customers are more expensive, and predict the expensive customers.
2. Provide recommendations to Health Management Organizations (HMOs) to lower their healthcare costs.

# Approach
1. Leverage data analysis techniques to clean data, remove null values and standardize the data.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gather insights from the data and form a correlation between factors affecting healthcare costs.
3. Apply statistical modeling and predictive analytics to develop accurate models for predicting high-cost individuals.
